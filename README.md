# OpenAPI Specification

This is the work project for [Lab 2](https://github.com/hguerrero/3scale-api-workshop/blob/master/docs/labs/lab02.md) of the [Red Hat API Integration &amp; Management Workshop](https://github.com/hguerrero/3scale-api-workshop)

## Example

[Locations-UserX.yaml](locations-api/Locations-UserX.yaml) contains a working example of the Locations API.

Edit this file to replace userX with your actual workshop assgined user number. For example if you are assigned user number **1**:

```bash
UserX
```

becomes =>

```bash
User1
```

You will need to change the file name as well as the API title inside the file.

```bash
---
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Locations-UserX
  description: Locations API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
```
